- Testing:
    a) More tests ALWAYS need to be written.
    b) ALL tests should be automated, so "make test" can accurately test
       everything at once.

- Code review:
    a) The extconf.rb scripts and the Makefiles are not very pretty, and since
       I have little experience with them, I'm not sure if I'm doing them right.
    b) Many of the methods are NOT exception-safe.  It should all be reviewed
       for correctness.
    c) Some of the code may need to be reviewed for correct return values.
    d) I don't think some of the sync stuff is correct, and I'm not sure how
       to test it.

- Particular documentation changes that need to be made:
    a) some classes are not documented.
    b) still many TODO's
    c) somtimes the term 'function' is used instead of 'method'
    d) what is the correct way to describe a the return value from an
       iterator, such as each()?
    e) documentation for interfaces that are common between classes

- Add to safe_mixin the ability to make sure a given module has already been
  mixed in; the reason for this is that if Enumerable is mixed in *after*
  PairEnumerableContainer, then include? will not work properly.

- I'm not sure if any of this will work under Windows.  Anyone want to make a
  port?
