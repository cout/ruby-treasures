Ruby Treasures 0.4
Copyright (C) 2002 Paul Brannan <paul@atdesk.com>

Ruby Treasures is a pet project of mine that I think contains a lot of nifty
add-ons for Ruby.  Some of these may be more useful than others; that's for
you to decide.

The project has just a few goals:
    - To implement common utility classes that are missing from the Ruby
      standard library.
    - Miscellaneous useful classes for writing Ruby applications.
    - Interesting hacks and tweaks to the interpreter and/or library that
      may or may not be of use to people.

The primary goal, however, is for me to have fun writing the library and to
learn something about Ruby in the process.

You can view the license in the file LICENSE.

You can compile it with:
    ruby extconf.rb
    make

Optionally, you can run the tests with:
    make test

Lastly, you can install it with:
    make install

The directory structure is as follows:
    ext/                C extensions go here
    lib/                The top level lib. directory
    lib/exc             Classes to work with exceptions
    lib/hacks           Interesting hacks
    lib/reactor         A reactor mechanism for multiplexed I/O
    lib/sync            Various thread synchronization routines
    test/               All tests for the library
    doc/                Documentation
    test/               Unit tests
    examples/           Example source
